I was in a group with Adam Schaeffer and Truman Padgett.

I want to make it clear that the work done in producer_consumer.c is entirely my own.

I am reaching out to help with those two getting their project done.
Truman's test script currently doesn't work and we don't know why. Truman reached out to some TAs and they couldn't help so he's going to ask the professor.

Truman asked to join our group so that he can get credit for this project if he can't get the test script to work before the deadline.

Like the last two projects, I felt like the work was an entirely independent-- so I'm fairly uncomfortable that they get to pass without doing any of the work. But technically they are both in my group now.


Anyways, thank you TAs for all your hard work! :D
